        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          As a passionate and self-taught Game Developer, I derive immense satisfaction from translating thoughts into playable realities. 
          I believe in consistent learning and sharing knowledge while maintaining a sense of joy in the process. 
          Collaborating on ambitious projects to bring game functionality to life is a pursuit I thoroughly enjoy. 
          It is my aspiration to contribute my skills and passion to a AAA game studio, collaborating with a like-minded team, 
          to produce innovative games that players can appreciate.

        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>
  
        <p>
          In my 8th grade, I was recognized with the Tech Award, an accolade that inspired me to establish the coding club in my high school. Since then, 
          I have successfully packaged several games, refining my coding skills along the way. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While attending the University of Advancing Technology, 
          I was honored to be included in the President's List and Dean's List for my exemplary academic performance during the first and second semesters.
